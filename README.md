# Solutions to the Leetcode problems

**NOTE**: This repo contains solutions I have done from leetcode, this is for
practice. Most of the time I do solve and move on and dont check on the solutions
and editorial to see if there is a better way. I do that, cause I wanna rethink 
at a later point and optmise my solution.
What is a good optimised solution for me - as long as Leetcode accepts the submission.
At times, when it says to use O(1) solution, I might end up using O(n) solution and
move on, later I come back and try it or check editorials.

So, these solutions might not be the very optimal ones. But they work !!

This is also a repo for me to look back at solutions and also check my progress
like how many problems am I solving per day, or what kind of problems I am solving
per day.

Two util scripts are there:
- `mkfile.py` : This is to create the file with proper python naming standards.
```console
$ ./mkfile.py "169. Majority Element"
```
This creates the file `169_majority_element.py`

- `favourite.py`: This helps to print file names which I think are imp or was
interesting to solve, so its easy for me to look back. It basically prints filenames
which has `tag: favourite` as a comment at the very top of the file.

```
$ ./favourite.py
27_remove_element.py
334_increasing_triplet_subsequence.py
328_odd_even_linked_list.py
189_rotate_array.py
167_two_sum_ii_input_array_is_sorted.py
11_container_with_most_water.py
23_merge_k_sorted_lists.py
2095_Delete_the_middle_node_of_a_linked_list.py
```
